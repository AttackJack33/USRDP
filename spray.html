        <h1>The Aerospray</h1>
        <span class="infotext">
            The Areospray MG is a main weapon that has on of the 
            best painting capabilities in Salmon Run. This weapon 
            is a lightweight weapon meaning that yyou move the fastest 
            in Salmon Run. The one part that the Aerospray 
            shines in is painting the environment. Its ability to paint 
            large amounts of turf in such short of a time is what makes 
            it a very good utility for your team 
            <img style="float: right; padding-left: 5px" src="img/videodata/tentabrella.gif"> 
            to be able to keep doing 
            their work. Keeping the environment painted ensures that you 
            and your teammates have accessible routes to deliver eggs or 
            reach the shoreline. Its trade-off though is its poor range 
            and very poor damage, but its extremely high fire rate makes 
            it great at handling crowd control and delivering eggs with 
            its high mobility but is also bad at taking out some technical 
            bosses. It does have the ability to take down Scrappers, 
            Slammin' Lids, Flipper Floppers, and Maws pretty well. Its 
            high mobility also allows you to run in, get eggs, and paint 
            the environment to give you and your teammates a route back 
            to the basket. Do be aware of your ink tank though because 
            while keeping the environment clean is important, it is also 
            important to make sure you have enought ink to do some fighting 
            as well.
