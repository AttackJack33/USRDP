        <h1>The Grizzco Stringer</h1>
        The Grizzco Stringer is an illegally modified version of the 
        Tri-Stringer that boasts in high damage and turfing capabilities 
        with poor ink efficiency. This main weapon is a heavyweight weapon, 
        meaning that you have the slowest move speed in Salmon Run. The 
        Grizzco Stringer has 9 shots compared to the usual 3 that is spread 
        across a horizontal line with varying height and proximity of each shot. 
        Assuming all the shots connect, a tap-shot will deal 315 damage and a full 
        charge will deal a whopping 1350 damage, being one of the only few weapons 
        that can tackle King Salmonids without the use of an Egg Launcher. Be 
        careful though, though it can ink large amounts of turf and deal high damage, 
        it can leave you vulnerable with a moderate charge rate and high ink consumption.


        The Splattershot is a main weapon that is versatile in many 
        different situations, even in Salmon Run. This main weapon is a 
        middleweight weapon, meaning that it allows you to move just
        faster than normalweight and heavyweight but not as fast as 
        lightweight weapons. The Splattershot can be used in any situation 
        with some exceptions. The Splattershot can be used 
        <img style="float: right;" src="img/videodata/tentabrella.gif"> 
        to clear out lessers 
        and bosses with ease, including egg delivery though it may not be 
        recommended based on certain team combinations. Its modest damage and 
        fire rate is a perfect all-rounder to take out almost every salmonid 
        boss with ease with an exception of the Stinger as other weapons can splat
        Stingers more efficiently than the Splattershot but can still get the job 
        done. Beware of Fly Fish though as going around splatting everything 
        can leave you with a low ink tank, making you vulnerable to missiles, 
        getting swarmed, and the inability to splat the said Fly Fish.
